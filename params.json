Unfortunately, it can be difficult to predict how many students will enroll in a given year, and inaccurate predictions can result in last-minute money shuffles, staff changes, and wasted educational time. Because budget allocations are made in the spring, long before students start in September, early and accurate predictions of student enrollment are crucial.\r\n\r\n###The Solution###\r\nTo answer these questions, we approached the problem in the following ways:\r\n  * Extensive Exploratory Data Analysis\r\n  * Linear Regression (School Level)\r\n  * Conditional Logit Model (Student Level)\r\n  * Decision Tree (Predict Misprojection)\r\n\r\n###Project Layout###\r\n  * Data_Pipeline: process raw data into structured data frame\r\n  * Data_Analysis: data visualization and regression analysis\r\n  * Tool_Box: main tool box for CPS usage to make prediction and diagnose prediction for the future\r\n\r\n###Installation###\r\n\r\n#### Git\r\nTo download the code we used for the project, you will need to clone the repository using Git. [Git](http://git-scm.com/) is used version control system we used to orginize our code. We hosted the code on [Github](http://github.com/). You can download Git [here](http://git-scm.com/downloads). Information on getting started with Git is [here](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Git-Basics). Additionally, you will need to create a Github account.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed Git, you will need to navigate in command line to the folder in which you want to download the code. Then you will need to clone the respository with the following commands. \r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/dssg/predicting_student_enrollment.git\r\ncd predicting_student_enrollment/\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### R\r\n\r\nWe did most of our analyses in R. R is available for free via the [R Project website](http://www.r-project.org) or, with a slightly friendlier user interface, as [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com). See [these resources](https://github.com/dssg/nfp#using-r) for a more detailed overview of R.\r\n\r\nMuch of R's functionality comes not from the base installation but from additional packages.  Details about how to install packages are available [here](http://www.r-bloggers.com/installing-r-packages).  Our code makes use of the following packages:\r\n\r\n* ggplot2\r\n* plyr\r\n* survival\r\n* clogitL1\r\n* randomForest\r\n\r\n### Team\r\n![CPS Team](http://dssg.io/img/posts/cps-team.png)\r\n\r\n  * [Vanessa Ko](https://github.com/vanessako), Political Science, McGill University\r\n  * [Andrew Landgraf](https://github.com/andland), Statistics, The Ohio State University\r\n  * [Tracy Schifeling](https://github.com/tracyschifeling), Statistics, Duke University\r\n  * [Zhou Ye](https://github.com/ZhouYeJava), Computer Science, Johns Hopkins University\r\n  * [Joe Walsh](https://github.com/jtwalsh0), Mentor\r\n\r\n### License\r\nCopyright (C) 2014 Data Science for Social Good Fellowship at the University of Chicago\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS,\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
