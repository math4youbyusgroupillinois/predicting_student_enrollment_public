<p>Statistical models and analysis of student enrollment to better allocate school budgets in Chicago. 
This project is a 2014 Data Science for Social Good project in partnership with Chicago Public Schools.</p>

<a id="project-description" class="anchor" href="#project-description" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Description</h3>

<p>Lack of accurate enrollment forecasting (at the individual school level) causes millions of dollars to be re-allocated every year causing administration and teaching disruption.</p>

<p>In the Chicago Public Schools system, each school's budget depends on how many students enroll there. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to predict how many students will enroll in a given year, and inaccurate predictions can result in last-minute money shuffles, staff changes, and wasted educational time. Because budget allocations are made in the spring, long before students start in September, early and accurate predictions of student enrollment are crucial.</p>

<h3>
<a id="the-solution" class="anchor" href="#the-solution" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Solution</h3>

<p>To answer these questions, we approached the problem in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Extensive Exploratory Data Analysis</li>
<li>Linear Regression (School Level)</li>
<li>Conditional Logit Model (Student Level)</li>
<li>Decision Tree (Predict Misprojection)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Data_Pipeline: process raw data into structured data frame</li>
<li>Data_Analysis: data visualization and regression analysis</li>
<li>Tool_Box: main tool box for CPS usage to make prediction and diagnose prediction for the future</li>
</ul>

<h4>
<a id="git" class="anchor" href="#git" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Git</h4>

<p>To download the code we used for the project, you will need to clone the repository using Git. <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is used version control system we used to orginize our code. We hosted the code on <a href="http://github.com/">Github</a>. You can download Git <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">here</a>. Information on getting started with Git is <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Git-Basics">here</a>. Additionally, you will need to create a Github account.</p>

<p>Once you have installed Git, you will need to navigate in command line to the folder in which you want to download the code. Then you will need to clone the respository with the following commands. </p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/dssg/predicting_student_enrollment.git
cd predicting_student_enrollment/
</code></pre>

<h4>
<a id="r" class="anchor" href="#r" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>R</h4>

<p>We did most of our analyses in R. R is available for free via the <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R Project website</a> or, with a slightly friendlier user interface, as <a href="http://www.rstudio.com">RStudio</a>. See <a href="https://github.com/dssg/nfp#using-r">these resources</a> for a more detailed overview of R.</p>

<p>Much of R's functionality comes not from the base installation but from additional packages.  Details about how to install packages are available <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/installing-r-packages">here</a>.  Our code makes use of the following packages:</p>

<ul>
<li>ggplot2</li>
<li>plyr</li>
<li>survival</li>
<li>clogitL1</li>
<li>randomForest</li>
</ul>
